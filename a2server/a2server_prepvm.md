# A2SERVER

The following steps explain how to prep the A2SERVER virtual machine,
specifically [VirtualBox][1], which has the notable virtue of being free.
However, you can also use other virtual machine products, such as those from
[Parallels][2] and [VMware][3], and the process should be similar.

If you're comfortable doing so, you may also customize the steps below as you
wish, or install Ubuntu Linux natively rather than in a VM.

* Download [VirtualBox 4.2.10][4].
* Download [Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS][5] (A2SERVER has been tested with the
  32-bit version only).
{: .space-after }
* Start VirtualBox, and go to Preferences.
* Click Input. Set the host key to right-alt, and uncheck Auto Capture
  Keyboard.
* Click OK.
{: .space-after }
* Click New to create a new virtual machine.
* Enter *A2SERVER* as the VM name, and select Linux/Ubuntu as the operating
  system.
* Enter 256 MB for memory.
{: .space-after }
* Under Virtual Hard Disk, leave the defaults (Start-up Disk, and Create new
  hard disk).
* Choose VMDK for hard disk file type.
* Leave the virtual disk file as Dynamically allocated.
* Leave the virtual disk file location as A2SERVER, and set the disk size to
  32 GB.
* Click Create, and then again in the next window.
{: .space-after }
* Click Settings.
* Click Storage. Click on \"Empty\" under \"IDE Controller\".
* Click on the small CD icon on the far right of the window, select \"Choose a
  virtual CD/DVD disk file...\", and choose the Ubuntu Server file you
  downloaded.
{: .space-after }
* Click Network.
* Change \"Attached To:\" to \"Bridged Adapter\".
* Change \"Name:\" to a __wired__{: .uline } network interface on your computer.  If you
  don't have one, use a USB-to-Ethernet adapter. (A2SERVER won't work over
  Wi-Fi when running in a VM.)
* *Optional but recommended: Under Advanced, change the MAC Address to
  080003F2FF59.*{: .fine-print }
* Click OK.
{: .space-after }
